## fio-pod README 
### Usage
`./fio-pod.sh -f filepod -c config -t testtypes -o otheropt`

eg: 

`./fio.pod.sh -f podfile -c fio_ceph -t read,write -o "--rate-iops=100"` 

### Where 

- `-f|--filepod` is file name where will be written ip addresses of pods planned to run test inside. It can be any name.
- `-c|--fconfig` is string describing test eg `fio_gluster` or `fio_ceph`, or any other description 
- `-t|--testtypes` comma separated list of fio tests to perform. Default is to run all `"read,write,rw,randread,randwrite,randrw"` 
- `-o|--otheropt`  quoted list of other supported pbench_fio options. Run `pbench_fio -h` in order to see them and if you want to 
change some of them, `otheropt` parameter will accept that. 

### Test description 

Once executed as below 

`./fio-pod.sh -f <filename> -c <config_name>  -t <testtype> -o <otheropt> ` 

script will run fio test inside pods whose ip addresses are collected to `filepod` file.  system pods such us router and/or docker-registry will 
not be taken into consideration 

This scripts uses `pbench_fio` which is part of [pbench test harness](https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench) which will install fio 
inside pods if not already done.

`fio-pod.sh` if used with `-o|--otheropt` will accept any further `pbench_fio` option. This enables to change default `pbench_fio` 
options by using `-o|--otheropt` switch with `fio-pod.sh`. For full list of options provided by `pbench_fio` run `pbench_fio -h`

`fio-pod` will on all OSE nodes install pbench tools and run `register-tool-set --remote=<ose_node_ip> ` to register tools on all of them. In case 
`register-tool-set` was ran previously ( we are checking existence of `/var/lib/pbench-agent/tools.default` which is generated by `register-tool-set`) we will not run it again.
The pbench data will be collected from host side. Inside pods we do not collect any pbench data 



### Prerequisite for running 
 
 - It requires fully operational OSE v3 environment. Read [openshift ansible guilde ](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible) how to set it up
 - SSH insde pods has to be enabled. Dockerfile which will build sshd enabled docker image can be found at [sshd enabled docker Dockerfile] (https://github.com/ekuric/e_docker/blob/master/Dockerfile-sshd)
 - pods where test will be run, need to be created in advance. An example of script for bulk pod creatiion can be found here [bulk pod creation] (https://github.com/ekuric/e_docker/tree/master/poolpodcreate)
 - If it is supposed for fio test to write to custom location, then it is necessary to specify that location with 
  `--directory` option in `otheropt` section for example `--directory=/var/lib/` and directory specified in `--directory` directive must exist prior test start
